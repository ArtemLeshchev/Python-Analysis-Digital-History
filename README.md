# Python-Digital-History-Analysis
Digital History is a project by a historian-youtuber Egor Yakovlev. I used to work with DH for a bit in 2021.

In this repo you will find some analysis based on posts from a DH's public club in VK social network https://vk.com/dighistory.

Language is Python. Libs are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

* **DH_source_data.xlsx**

The original dataset.

* **DH_The most commented posts.ipynb**

I determine outliers and try to find out what categories are the most 'commented' among these outliers.
The purpose: to understand what topics should be mentioned more often in order to increase blog engagement.
The resut: we will see that the most commented categories are 'Новейшее время' (Contemporary history), "Новое время" (Modern era) and "Великая отечественная война" (the Great Patriotic war).

* **DH_Pearson correlation.ipynb**

As the title says, in this file I perform Pearson correlation analysis (measuring linear correlation between two sets of data). 
The purpose: to detect the relationship and dependensies between variables.

* **DH_Pandas_training.ipynb**

Practising Pandas according with the docs https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html.
