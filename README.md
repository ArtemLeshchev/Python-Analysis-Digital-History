# Python-Digital-History-Analysis
Digital History is a project by a historian-youtuber Egor Yakovlev. I used to work with DH for a bit in 2021.

In this repo you will find some analysis based on materials from a DH's public in VK social network https://vk.com/dighistory.

Language is Python.
Libs are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

In the file "DH_The most commented posts" I analyse the outliers and try to understand what categories are the most 'commented' among the outliers.
In the final, we will see that the most commented categories in outliers are "Новейшее время", "Новое время" and "Великая отечественная война".
